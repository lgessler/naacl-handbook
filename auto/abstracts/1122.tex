Traditional approaches to dialogue segmentation perform reasonably well on synthetic or written dialogues but suffer when dealing with spoken, noisy dialogs. In addition, such methods require careful tuning of hyperparameters. We propose to leverage a novel approach that is based on dialogue summaries. Experiments on different datasets showed that the new approach outperforms popular state-of-the-art algorithms in unsupervised topic segmentation and requires less setup.
