Event temporal graphs have been shown as con venient and effective representations of com plex temporal relations between events in text.  Recent studies, which employ pre-trained lan guage models to auto-regressively generate lin earised graphs for constructing event temporal  graphs, have shown promising results. How ever, these methods have often led to subopti mal graph generation as the linearised graphs  exhibit set characteristics which are instead  treated sequentially by language models. This  discrepancy stems from the conventional text  generation objectives, leading to erroneous pe nalisation of correct predictions caused by the  misalignment of elements in target sequences.  To address these challenges, we reframe the  task as a conditional set generation problem,  proposing a Set-aligning Framework tailored  for the effective utilisation of Large Language  Models (LLMs). The framework incorporates  data augmentations and set-property regularisa tions designed to alleviate text generation loss  penalties associated with the linearised graph  edge sequences, thus encouraging the genera tion of more relation edges. Experimental re sults show that our framework surpasses exist ing baselines for event temporal graph genera tion. Furthermore, under zero-shot settings, the  structural knowledge introduced through our  framework notably improves model generalisa tion, particularly when the training examples  available are limited.
