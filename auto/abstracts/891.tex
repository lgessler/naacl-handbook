This paper investigates using Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically perform web software tasks using click, scroll, and text in- put operations. Previous approaches, such as reinforcement learning (RL) or imitation learning, are inefficient to train and task-specific. Our method uses filtered Document Object Model (DOM) elements as observations and performs tasks step-by-step, sequentially generating small programs based on the current observations. We use in-context learning, either benefiting from a single manually provided example, or an automatically generated example based on a successful zero-shot trial. We evaluate our proposed method on the MiniWob++ benchmark. With only one in-context example, our WebWISE method using gpt-3.5-turbo achieves similar or better performance than other methods that require many demonstrations or trials.
