{\bfseries Abstract:}
We will explore the synergy between open data and collaborative construction with a gender lens, unraveling how this combination becomes a fundamental catalyst for the creation of more equitable and bias-free deep language models. We will take a close look at how the transparency and accessibility of open data, along with the active inclusion of gender perspectives in its construction, contribute significantly to mitigating inherent biases in LLMs. We will see how the use of practical strategies demonstrate how this approach not only addresses crucial challenges, but also drives innovation towards a future where NLPs and LLMs more accurately and fairly reflect the diversity of our society. In conclusion, we propose a path towards collaboratively building a more inclusive and equitable technological future.
