  {Spatial and Temporal Language Understanding: Representation, Reasoning, and Grounding}

  {\daydateyear, 14:00 -- 17:30}
  {Don Alberto 3}

In this tutorial, we overview the cutting edge research on spatial language understanding and its applications. This includes the way the spatial semantics are represented, the existing datasets and annotations, the connection between information extraction models, qualitative reasoning based on spatial language and end-to-end deep learning models. We overview the recent transformer-based language-models used for spatial language comprehension and the related challenges. We clarify the role of spatial language in grounding language in visual world and the related applications in navigation and way finding agents as well as human machine interaction and dialogue systems.
