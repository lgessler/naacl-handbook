    *SEM brings together researchers interested in the semantics of (many and diverse!) natural languages and its computational modeling. The conference embraces data-driven, neural, and probabilistic approaches, as well as symbolic approaches and everything in between; practical applications as well as theoretical contributions are welcome. The long-term goal of *SEM is to provide a stable forum for the growing number of NLP researchers working on all aspects of semantics of (many and diverse!) natural languages.

    Topics of interest:

\begin{itemize}
\item Lexical semantics and word representations
\item Compositional semantics and sentence representations
\item Statistical, machine learning, and deep learning methods in semantic tasks
\item Multilingual and cross-lingual semantics
\item Word sense disambiguation and induction
\item Semantic parsing, and syntax-semantics interface
\item Frame semantics and semantic role labeling
\item Formal approaches to semantics
\item Extraction of events and of causal and temporal relations
\item Entity linking, pronouns and coreference
\item Discourse, pragmatics, and dialogue
\item Machine reading
\item Extra-propositional aspects of meaning
\item Multiword and idiomatic expressions
\item Metaphor, irony, and humor
\item Knowledge mining and acquisition
\item Common sense reasoning
\item Language generation
\item Semantics in NLP applications: sentiment analysis, abusive language detection, summarization, fact-checking, etc.
\item Multidisciplinary research on semantics
\item Grounding and multimodal semantics
\item Psycholinguistics
\item Interpretability and Explainability
\item Human semantic processing
\item Semantic annotation, evaluation, and resources
\item Ethical aspects and bias in semantic representations
\end{itemize}
