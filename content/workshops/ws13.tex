The rapid advancement of natural language processing (NLP) research has led to a variety of applications spanning a wide range of domains. As NLP applications are being used by more people in their everyday lives, and are increasingly powered by data generated by people, it is more important than ever that NLP research adopt and develop methods to incorporate people into that research in meaningful ways. Perspectives from human-computer interaction (HCI) can help NLP researchers and practitioners to advance the field in ways that are aligned with people's needs, raising novel questions and research directions for both NLP and HCI.

The goal of the 3rd Bridging Human--Computer Interaction and Natural Language Processing Workshop is to bring researchers and practitioners from both disciplines (HCI & NLP) together to

\begin{enumerate}
    \item discuss their shared research interests;
    \item highlight work at the intersection of these fields;
    \item identify challenges and opportunities for productive interdisciplinary collaboration.
\end{enumerate}

We especially invite graduate students and early career researchers to participate.
