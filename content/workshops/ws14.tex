The goal of AmericasNLP is to encourage and increase the visibility of work on the Indigenous languages of the Americas. It aims to encourage research on NLP, computational linguistics, corpus linguistics and speech for Indigenous languages, to connect researchers and professionals from underrepresented communities and native speakers of endangered languages with the ACL community, and, more generally, to promote machine learning approaches suitable for low-resource languages.
