SemEval is a series of international natural language processing (NLP) research workshops whose mission is to advance the current state of the art in semantic analysis and to help create high-quality annotated datasets in a range of increasingly challenging problems in natural language semantics. Each year's workshop features a collection of shared tasks in which computational semantic analysis systems designed by different teams are presented and compared.

SemEval is sponsored by the SIGLEX Special Interest Group on the Lexicon of the Association for Computational Linguistics. For more information on SemEval and its history, please see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SemEval.
